configuration and access requirements.

Important points
================

* Do not assume that a service named in one part of the course can be reached
  from every other Monsoon3 service. Follow the connection route in the
  official guide. For example:
  * Github repositories should be accessed using https, not ssh.
  * Some Cylc tools and Rose edit will not work on compute nodes.
* Complete the site-supported repository authentication setup before running
  Rosie commands.
* Do not place passwords, authentication codes, tokens, or private connection
  details in course files, terminal transcripts, issues, or pull requests.

Getting help
============

If a connection or authentication step fails, check that you are using the
service and route specified in the current Monsoon3 User Guide. Do not work
around site security controls or store credentials in plain text. Use the
official `Monsoon3 support guidance`_ if the documented setup does not work.
