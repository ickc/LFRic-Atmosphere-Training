Ocean and Sea Ice
=================

In Momentum configurations, the ocean and sea-ice components provide the
evolving lower boundary beneath the atmosphere over the oceans and polar
regions.

The marine physical models used in current Momentum training are NEMO for the
ocean and SI3 for sea ice. They sit alongside other components such as JULES.

Why marine coupling matters
---------------------------

Ocean and sea-ice processes occur at the interface between the atmosphere and
the marine environment. They control how heat, freshwater, salt, carbon, and
momentum are stored, transported, and exchanged with the atmosphere.

The ocean evolves more slowly than the atmosphere, but it has a long memory.
Sea-surface temperature, ocean heat content, salinity, currents, and surface
mixing can all affect surface fluxes, evaporation, boundary-layer structure,
clouds, precipitation, tropical variability, and extratropical weather systems.

Sea ice is also an active part of the lower boundary. It changes surface
albedo, insulates the ocean from the atmosphere, modifies exchanges of heat and
moisture, and changes freshwater and salt budgets as it forms, melts, and
moves. In polar regions, the coupled atmosphere-ocean-sea-ice state can
strongly affect both weather forecasts and climate simulations.

What NEMO represents
--------------------

NEMO, the Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean, is the ocean modelling
framework used for global and regional marine configurations. It represents the
evolving three-dimensional ocean state, including currents, temperature,
salinity, sea-surface height, and ocean mixing.

NEMO is driven by surface forcing and boundary information such as wind stress,
heat fluxes, freshwater fluxes, river input, sea-ice interaction, and lateral
boundary conditions in regional domains.

Using this information, NEMO calculates processes including:

* ocean circulation and currents,
* sea-surface temperature and salinity,
* transport of heat, freshwater, salt, and tracers,
* vertical mixing and mixed-layer evolution,
* interaction with coastlines, bathymetry, and ocean topography,
* regional shelf-sea and global ocean behaviour.

What SI3 represents
-------------------

SI3, the Sea Ice modelling Integrated Initiative, is the native sea-ice engine
in NEMO. It represents the growth, melt, drift, deformation, and thermodynamic
state of sea ice.

Sea ice is not a uniform surface. Within a model grid cell, there may be open
water, thin ice, thick ice, snow-covered ice, ridged ice, and melt ponds. SI3
represents this mixture using sub-grid categories rather than trying to model
every individual floe and lead.

SI3 calculates processes including:

* sea-ice concentration and thickness,
* snow depth on sea ice,
* sea-ice growth and melt at the top and base,
* sea-ice movement under winds and ocean currents,
* deformation, ridging, and opening of leads,
* melt ponds and surface albedo effects.

Coupling with the atmosphere
----------------------------

In coupled Momentum systems, NEMO and SI3 exchange surface information with the
atmosphere through the coupler. The atmosphere supplies near-surface winds,
heat fluxes, freshwater fluxes, and radiative forcing. The marine components
return sea-surface temperature, sea-ice area, ice and snow state, and surface
properties that affect fluxes back to the atmosphere.

The important point for this LFRic Atmosphere training is that the ocean and
sea ice are active model components, not static boundary datasets. Their
initial conditions, coupling choices, surface states, and configuration details
can all influence atmospheric behaviour, especially for longer forecasts,
seasonal prediction, climate simulations, and polar applications.

Marine configurations
---------------------

The Joint Marine Modelling Programme develops two families of marine
configurations used in Met Office and partner systems:

Global Ocean and Sea Ice configurations
   GOSI configurations are global NEMO-SI3 configurations used in climate,
   Earth system, seasonal-prediction, and coupled weather-forecast systems.
   GOSI9 is a traceable hierarchy of global ocean and sea-ice models at 1 deg,
   1/4 deg, and 1/12 deg horizontal resolution, all using 75 vertical levels.
Coastal Ocean configurations
   CO configurations are regional shelf-sea configurations. The North West
   European Shelf configurations include AMM7 at about 7 km resolution and
   AMM15 at about 1.5 km resolution, both with 51 vertical levels.

Useful detail to recognise
--------------------------

Learners do not need the full numerical detail at this stage, but it is useful
to recognise two ideas that appear repeatedly in marine modelling:

Grids
   Ocean models use their own horizontal and vertical grids. NEMO global
   configurations commonly use ORCA tripolar grids, which avoid placing a
   singular grid point in the Arctic Ocean.
Parameterisations
   Even high-resolution ocean and sea-ice models cannot resolve all important
   processes. Ocean eddies, vertical turbulence, ice floes, leads, ridges, and
   ice-thickness variation must often be parameterised.
