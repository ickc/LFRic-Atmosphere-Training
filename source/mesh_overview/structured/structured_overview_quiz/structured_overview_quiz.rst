   ## What is a structured grid?
   1. [x] A grid where 1D coordinate arrays are combined to form multi-dimensional spatial locations
       > Correct!
   1. [ ] A random arrangement of spatial data with no pattern
       > A structured grid, by definition, has an ordered and predictable pattern—not a random arrangement.
   1. [ ] A grid where each point represents time instead of space
       > Structured grids represent spatial—not temporal—locations.
   1. [ ] A grid based on unstructured data relationships
       > This describes an unstructured grid, not a structured one.

   ## In a structured 2D grid representing Earth's surface, what direction do rows typically represent?
   1. [ ] South to North
       > South to North is the direction of the columns, not the rows.
   1. [ ] North to South
       > North to South is along the columns, not the rows, and the columns run South to North.
   1. [x] West to East
       > Correct! In structured 2D Earth grids, rows span from West to East.
   1. [ ] East to West
       > Rows run from West to East, so this is incorrect.

   ## Why are structured grids considered intuitive for modelling physical space?
   1. [x] The physical location on Earth relates directly to the location within the data array on
       > Correct! This is what makes structured grids easy to use.
   1. [ ] They use random placement to approximate locations
       > Random placement is a characteristic of unstructured grids.
   1. [ ] They rely on machine learning to guess spatial relationships
       > Structured grids don't need ML—they use clear spatial indexing.
   1. [ ] They avoid spatial mapping for simpler performance
       > Spatial mapping is central to the design of structured grids, not something to be avoided.

   ## Which of the following is NOT a key characteristic of structured grids?
   1. [ ] Predictable layout
       > This is a defining feature of structured grids.
   1. [ ] Neighbouring data points are spatial neighbours
       > This is true for structured grids—they follow consistent spatial relationships.
   1. [x] Arbitrary placement of grid cells
       > Correct! Arbitrary placement defines unstructured grids.
   1. [ ] Alignment with physical space
       > Structured grids mirror physical layouts.

   ## What major issue occurs with structured grids near the Earth's poles?
   1. [ ] The grid becomes non-deterministic
       > No, they remain deterministic but suffer from distortion.
   1. [x] Grid cells compress, leading to singularities and inaccuracies
       > Correct! This compression leads to problematic singularities in structured grids.
   1. [ ] The grid becomes too sparse for accurate modelling
       > The opposite happens—points become too close together.
   1. [ ] Latitudes disappear near the poles
       > Incorrect! grids suffer from distortion.

   ## What approach does this chapter introduce for addressing polar singularities in structured grids?
   1. [ ] Making the pole cells larger while keeping the same latitude-longitude structure
       > Incorrect. The chapter explains that the compression near the poles is a limitation of the structured-grid layout.
   1. [x] Moving to an unstructured mesh such as the cubed-sphere
       > Correct! The cubed-sphere avoids the polar singularity by mapping six square faces onto the sphere.
   1. [ ] Ignoring data near the poles
       > No. Discarding polar data does not address the underlying grid problem.
   1. [ ] Replacing grid values with time coordinates
       > Incorrect. Changing the type of coordinate stored in the data would not remove the spatial distortion.

   ## What is a challenge of using cubed-sphere unstructured meshes?
   1. [ ] They reintroduce polar singularities
       > Incorrect. Cubed-sphere grids solve the polar singularity problem.
   1. [x] Organising data in a 2D format becomes more difficult
       > Correct! The face-based structure complicates 2D array representation.
   1. [ ] They increase distortion near the equator
       > Distortion is relatively minimal near the equator.
   1. [ ] They are less accurate than structured grids
       > This is not generally true—unstructured grids can be highly accurate.
