*********************************
Practical using unstructured data
*********************************

The Mesh Tutorial provides practical training on handling LFRic unstructured
mesh data.

All tutorial content is delivered through interactive Jupyter notebooks. The
upstream material comes from `iris-mesh-tutorial
<https://github.com/scitools-classroom/iris-mesh-tutorial>`_ and is provided in
this repository under:

.. code-block:: text

   notebooks/iris-mesh-tutorial/

New to these tools?
-------------------
This practical is about working with LFRic unstructured mesh data. It uses Git,
the command line, Conda, Python, and JupyterLab. If you are new to Python or
have not used notebooks before, read :ref:`using-jupyter-notebooks` before
starting the setup below. If the Git, terminal, or environment setup commands
are unfamiliar, use the resources in this section as optional preparation or as
reference material while you work through the notebooks.

The most important ideas for this practical are:

* A Git repository is a version-controlled project. Cloning a repository
  creates a local copy on your machine.
* The terminal runs commands in a current working directory. Commands such as
  ``cd my_directory`` and ``git clone`` depend on where you are in the file
  system.
* A Python environment holds the packages this practical needs. At the Met
  Office and on Monsoon3 that environment comes from ``module load scitools``;
  on your own machine you build one with conda.
* A Jupyter kernel is the Python process that runs notebook cells. Choose the
  kernel that matches the environment you set up below.

   * - Area
     - Use this when
     - Recommended resource
   * - Git and GitHub
     - You need to understand repositories, commits, branches, remotes, or why
       the training material is hosted on GitHub.
     - Start with the official GitHub pages on `About GitHub and Git
       <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/about-github-and-git>`_
       and `Git basics <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/git-basics>`_.
   * - Cloning a repository
     - You need help with the ``git clone`` command used below.
     - Use GitHub's official `Cloning a repository
       <https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository>`_
       guide.
   * - Branches and pull requests
     - You want context for how changes are usually made and reviewed in a
       GitHub-hosted project.
     - Read GitHub's official `GitHub flow
       <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow>`_
       guide.
   * - Git as a version-control tool
     - You want the Git project's own reference material, or a longer
       beginner-friendly worked lesson.
     - Use the official `Pro Git book
       <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control>`_
       for background, or the `Software Carpentry Git novice lesson
       <https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/>`_ for a practical tutorial.
   * - Terminal and file paths
     - You are not yet comfortable with commands such as ``cd``, moving around
       folders, or running commands from the correct directory.
     - Work through the `Software Carpentry Unix Shell lesson
       <https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/>`_. It is not specific to
       LFRic, but it covers the command-line skills used here.
   * - Jupyter and notebooks
     - You are new to notebooks or want to understand what JupyterLab is before
       running ``jupyter lab``.
     - Start with :ref:`using-jupyter-notebooks`, then use the official
       `Project Jupyter documentation <https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/>`_
       for more detail.
   * - Notebook cells and kernels
     - You need to understand how to run cells, switch kernels, or stop a
       kernel that is still running.
     - Use :ref:`using-jupyter-notebooks` for the course workflow, then
       JupyterLab's `Notebooks
       <https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/notebook.html>`_ page
       for more detail.
   * - Python environments
     - You need help understanding ``conda create``, ``conda activate``, or why
       the practical uses a named environment.
     - Use the official conda `Getting started with conda
       <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html>`_
       and `Managing environments
       <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html>`_
       documentation. For the Jupyter kernel command used below, see IPython's
       `Installing the IPython kernel
       <https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html>`_
       page.

If you are completely new to these tools, a useful preparation route is:

1. Learn enough terminal usage to move between directories and run commands.
2. Read the GitHub introduction to Git and practise cloning a repository.
3. Read the JupyterLab interface and notebook basics pages.
4. Return to this practical and follow the setup commands exactly.

Get the training repository
---------------------------
If you do not already have this repository locally, clone it:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/MetOffice/LFRic-Atmosphere-Training.git
   cd LFRic-Atmosphere-Training

If you already have a local clone, move into it:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd /path/to/LFRic-Atmosphere-Training

Set up the Python environment
-----------------------------
The tutorial needs Iris, GeoVista, and the regridding tools. How you get them
depends on your platform.

.. tab-set::
   :sync-group: site

   .. tab-item:: Met Office
      :sync: met-office

      You do not need a separate environment. The Met Office science software
      stack already provides the UGRID-capable Iris and GeoVista packages used
      here:

      .. code-block:: bash

         module load scitools

      The notebooks then run under the default Python 3 kernel.

   .. tab-item:: Monsoon
      :sync: monsoon

      .. include:: /include/monsoon3-help.rst

      Load the science software stack:

      .. code-block:: bash

         module load scitools

      The notebooks then run under the default Python 3 kernel.

   .. tab-item:: Other
      :sync: other

      .. include:: /include/other-platform.rst

      Create a conda environment and register it as a Jupyter kernel:

      .. code-block:: bash

         conda create -n lfric-mesh python=3.12 -y
         conda activate lfric-mesh
         conda install -c conda-forge esmpy -y
         python -m pip install -e '.[notebooks]'
         python -m ipykernel install --user --name lfric-mesh \
             --display-name "Python (lfric-mesh)"

      Activate this environment in every new terminal before starting
      JupyterLab, and select the ``Python (lfric-mesh)`` kernel in the
      notebooks.

.. include:: /include/opengl-software-rendering.rst

Start the tutorial
------------------
Once the environment is set up:

1. Move to the tutorial notebook directory:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd notebooks/iris-mesh-tutorial/notebooks

2. Start JupyterLab:

   .. code-block:: bash

      jupyter lab

3. In the JupyterLab file browser, open the first tutorial notebook,
   ``00_Mesh_Tutorial_Intro.ipynb``.

4. Choose the kernel for your platform:

   .. tab-set::
      :sync-group: site

      .. tab-item:: Met Office
         :sync: met-office

         Use the default Python 3 kernel provided by ``scitools``.

      .. tab-item:: Monsoon
         :sync: monsoon

         Use the default Python 3 kernel provided by ``scitools``.

      .. tab-item:: Other
         :sync: other

         Select ``Kernel -> Change Kernel -> Python (lfric-mesh)``. If
         JupyterLab asks you to choose a kernel as the notebook opens, select
         ``Python (lfric-mesh)`` from that dialog instead.

.. important::
   Always launch JupyterLab from within
   ``notebooks/iris-mesh-tutorial/notebooks`` to ensure paths and imports work
   correctly.

After running ``jupyter lab``, a new browser window or tab should automatically
open. If it does not open automatically, copy the URL shown in the terminal
into your browser.

Recommended learning path
-------------------------
The notebooks are ordered by filename so they appear in sequence in JupyterLab.

1. Work through the core content in this order:

   - ``00_Mesh_Tutorial_Intro.ipynb``
   - ``01_Load_and_Examine.ipynb``
   - ``02_Meshes.ipynb``
   - ``03_Plotting.ipynb``
   - ``04_Regridding.ipynb``
   - ``05_RegionExtraction.ipynb``

2. Complete the consolidation exercises:

   - ``06_Exercise_01.ipynb``
   - ``07_Exercise_02.ipynb``

Optional auxiliary content
--------------------------
After completing the core pathway, optional auxiliary notebooks are available:

- ``80_Bonus_01_mesh_from_numbers.ipynb``
- ``81_Bonus_02_Mesh_Connectivities_demo.ipynb``
- ``82_Bonus_03_MeshCube_Extraction.ipynb``
