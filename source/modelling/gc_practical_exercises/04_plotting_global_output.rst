Plotting your data
==================

Once you have run your workflow, you will likely want to visualise the output
data. There are several ways you can do this. Here we cover two methods: using
terminal GUI tools and using Python with the Iris library.

Using GUI tools
---------------

For quick visualisation and inspection of NetCDF data files, you can use
graphical tools such as **ncview** and **xconv**. These tools provide a fast
way to explore datasets without writing any code, making them useful for
checking file contents, verifying dimensions, and performing an initial quality
check before more detailed analysis.

ncview
~~~~~~

``ncview`` is a lightweight graphical browser for NetCDF files. It can display
2D fields, animate data through time, inspect values, and switch between
variables and dimensions. It is particularly useful for obtaining a quick
overview of model output or observational datasets.

Example:

.. tab-set::
   :sync-group: site

   .. tab-item:: Met Office
      :sync: met-office

      .. code-block:: bash

         ncview temperature.nc

   .. tab-item:: Monsoon
      :sync: monsoon

      .. include:: /include/monsoon3-help.rst

      .. code-block:: bash

         ncview temperature.nc

   .. tab-item:: Other
      :sync: other

      .. include:: /include/other-platform.rst

      .. code-block:: bash

         ncview temperature.nc

Useful tasks include:

* Browsing available variables in a file
* Stepping through time slices
* Viewing simple animations
* Examining data ranges and missing values

xconv
~~~~~

``xconv`` is a graphical data exploration and conversion tool commonly used
within the atmospheric and climate modelling community. It supports NetCDF
files as well as several meteorological data formats and provides facilities
for plotting, inspecting dimensions, and converting data between formats.

Example:

.. tab-set::
   :sync-group: site

   .. tab-item:: Met Office
      :sync: met-office

      .. code-block:: bash

         xconv

   .. tab-item:: Monsoon
      :sync: monsoon

      .. code-block:: bash

         xconv

   .. tab-item:: Other
      :sync: other

      .. include:: /include/other-platform.rst

      .. code-block:: bash

         xconv

After launching the application:

#. Open a NetCDF file.
#. Select a variable from the variable list.
#. Use **Plot Data** to display the selected field.
#. Navigate dimensions such as time, level, latitude, and longitude using the
   GUI controls.

* xconv setup guide: https://ncas-cms.github.io/xconv-doc/html/setup.html

When should I use GUI tools?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GUI tools are ideal for:

* Quickly checking that a file contains the expected variables
* Exploring dimensions and metadata
* Verifying model output before analysis
* Performing a rapid visual quality-control check

For reproducible analysis, processing large datasets, or creating
publication-quality figures, command-line tools and scripting languages such as
Python are generally more appropriate.

If these tools are installed via environment modules on your system, you may
first need to load them before use:

.. tab-set::
   :sync-group: site

   .. tab-item:: Met Office
      :sync: met-office

      .. code-block:: bash

         module load ncview
         module load xconv

   .. tab-item:: Monsoon
      :sync: monsoon

      .. code-block:: bash

         module load ncview
         module load xconv

   .. tab-item:: Other
      :sync: other

      .. include:: /include/other-platform.rst

      Install ``ncview`` and ``xconv`` yourself, or use the Python route
      below instead.

Refer to your local HPC documentation for the exact module names available on
your platform.

Using Python
------------

The output files are in NetCDF format, which can be read using a variety of
software packages. Python provides more flexibility and allows for more complex
visualisations. Below is an example of how to read and plot NetCDF data using
the Iris and Matplotlib libraries.

.. code-block:: python

   import os
   from pathlib import Path

   import iris
   import iris.quickplot as qplt
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   # Set the path to the data.
   path_to_data = Path("path/to/your/data")

   # List what that path contains (up to 10 files).
   print(os.listdir(path_to_data)[:10])

   # Load one output file to inspect available cubes.
   print(iris.load(path_to_data / "data_file.pp"))

   # Load a cube from a NetCDF file.
   surface_temperature_cube = iris.load_cube(
       path_to_data / "output_file.nc", "surface_temperature"
   )

   # Change the units from Kelvin to Celsius.
   surface_temperature_cube.convert_units("celsius")

   # Choose the time slice to plot (e.g. the first time slice).
   time_slice = 0

   # Plot the data.
   qplt.contourf(surface_temperature_cube[time_slice, :, :])
   plt.gca().coastlines()
   plt.show()

The resulting plot can be seen below.
