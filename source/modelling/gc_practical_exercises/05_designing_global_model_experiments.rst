.. admonition:: Thought experiment: How would you design your experiment?

   As scientists we want to explore how climate models perform and respond to
   changes. How sensitive are they to   CO2 or what impact does an eddy
   parametrisation have on ocean circulation. **Think** about what parameters
   you would want to test within a global model? Once you have an idea, think
   about the next questions.

   * Where you might change this - is it in the **configuration namelist**
     settings within the workflow or in a ** source code**?

   * Browse the source code and workflow to look see how you might make this
     change.

   * What **diagnostic** would you plot to see the change?

.. Note::

   If you decide to test your own experiment with a code or configuration
   change, be ready to do lots of debugging! If you want an example which is
   tried and tested, use the given examples below.

.. admonition:: Real World Example: Snow Albedo Tuning in HadGEM3 GC3.1

   `Kuhlbrodt et al. (2018)
   <https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2018MS001370>`_
   describe a tuning change made during the development of the low-resolution
   version of HadGEM3 GC3.1:

      To achieve an acceptable simulation of Arctic sea ice thickness it proved
      necessary to reduce the albedo of snow on sea-ice by 2% in N96O1 for both
      infra-red (0.70 reduced to 0.68) and visible (0.98 to 0.96) parts of the
      solar spectrum, with all values well within observational constraints.
      This change was required due to the 1° ocean model failing to advect
      sufficient warm water into the Arctic Ocean through the narrow straits
      connecting the Atlantic with the Arctic.

   This is a good example of a **configuration namelist** change — a small
   parameter adjustment motivated by a known model bias which had a measurable
   impact on a key climate variable (Arctic sea ice thickness).

Now use the following practical exercises to explore different experiment
configurations. You will need to use what you learned in the running and
navigating exercises to edit and run the experiments. For analysis, you can use
what you learnt in the visualisation exercises. You can also use the thoughts
above to design your own experiment and test it out.
