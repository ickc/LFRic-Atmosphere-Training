************************************
Editing a Regional Nesting Suite
************************************

Once you have copied the regional nesting suite, the next step is to navigate
to your copy and open it using the Rose graphical user interface (GUI).

Step 1: Navigate to the suite directory
----------------------------------------

Open a terminal and move to the directory where your copy of the suite is
located, replacing ``<suite-id>`` with the new suite ID that ``rosie``
reported:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd ~/roses/<suite-id>

Step 2: Open the suite in the Rose GUI
---------------------------------------

Launch the Rose editor by running:

.. include:: /include/rose-edit.rst

Step 3: Setting Up the Regional Nesting Suite
----------------------------------------------

Once the GUI is open, you can begin configuring the suite for your specific
experiment or run by navigating through the tabs on the left side of the
window.

General Run Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Navigate to the ``General run options`` tab to define the key settings required
to run your nesting suite.

   editor.

Site and Machine Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **SITE**
  Select the machine where the nesting suite will run (e.g. *Met Office EX
  "moex-cray"*).

- **EX HOST**
  Choose the execution host group (e.g. *MONSOON3*, *EXA/EXB*, or *EXC/EXD*
  depending on availability).

Project Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **PROJECT_NAME**
  Specify the project code used for accounting or charging the run (e.g.
  ``training``).

Model Run Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **RUN_LFRIC_LAM_IN_DEV_MODE**
  Enables additional graphing and debugging tasks for the LFRic LAM.
  - ``true``: Run LFRic with development diagnostics
  - ``false``: Skip LFRic development features

- **RUN_UM_LAM**
  Determines whether the UM LAM is run alongside the LFRic LAM.
  - ``true``: Run both UM and LFRic (useful for comparison)
  - ``false``: Run only LFRic LAM

Post-processing Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

LFRic data is produced on an unstructured grid. If required, it can be
post-processed onto a structured grid for analysis.

- **RUN_LFRIC_POSTPROCESS**
  Enables post-processing of LFRic output.
  - ``true``: Convert output to a structured grid
  - ``false``: Keep native unstructured output

.. admonition:: 💡 Tips
   :class: tip

   - Hover over the **hand icon** in the GUI or click the **settings icon**
     next to each option to view additional help.
   - Start with default values for training exercises before experimenting with
     custom configurations.
   - Running both UM and LFRic LAMs is recommended for validation and
     comparison during learning.

Cycling Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In this section, you will configure the ``cycling options`` for your model
experiment using the rose GUI. These settings control how the model progresses
from one cycle to the next and define the start and end times for your run.

The interface shown below highlights the key options available.

For this self-learning exercise, you can use the following configuration:

- Set **CASE_STUDIES** to ``false``
- Define a short experiment window using:

  - ``INITIAL_CYCLE_POINT`` = ``20250508T0000Z``
  - ``FINAL_CYCLE_POINT`` = ``20250509T0000Z``

- Keep **CYCLE_INT_HR** = ``24``
- Leave **FREE_RUN** = ``false``
- Leave **USE_OSTIA** = ``false``

This setup provides a simple, manageable configuration for training purposes.

Driving Model Set-up
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run the Limited Area Model, you will have to use a driving model to obtain
the initial data from. This can be set up in the driving model window. You can
start the regional model from several options such as UM global model, ECMWF
forecast fields, archived analysis files, etc. These options can be chosen from
the driving model window. You can also choose the resolution of the driving
model, number of processors needed, etc, from this sections.

Nested Region 1 Set-UP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section allows you to define the **nested domain** for your limited area
model (LAM). You will specify both the **region name** and the **number of
resolutions (experiments)** you want to run (eg., if you are planning to run
the limited area model at two different resolutions such as 4.4 and 1.5kms,
then choose resolution as '2' here)

Once this is set, move to **Resolution 1 setup** to configure each experiment.


Resolution 1 Set-Up
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section defines the **horizontal and vertical resolution** and links the
required **ancillary data**.

.. note:: Ancillary data

   The ancillaries can be generated using the regional ancillary suite. If the
   ancillaries for your specific domain and resolution are already available,
   you can copy those ancillaries to the machine of your choice.

   Please get in touch with ``Momentum_Partnerships@metoffice.gov.uk``
   for all enquiries regarding the ancillaries.


Config 1 Set-Up (Science Configuration)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section allows you to configure the **science options** and **model
behaviour** for your limited area model experiment.

.. figure:: /_static/config1_setup.png

In this panel, you will define the key scientific settings for your model run.


.. tip:: 💡 Naming Your Region, Resolution & Configuration

   When choosing a name for your nested region, resolution, and configuration,
   you are free to enter anything you like as long as it does not contain
   spaces or periods.

   The idea is to choose names that are meaningful to you so that when you look
   back at your suite output directory in the future, you can remember what you
   did!

   **Example:**

   - Region: ``UK``
   - Resolution: ``4p4_L70``
   - Configuration: ``RAL3P2``

   This corresponds to a 4.4 km resolution model over the UK with 70 vertical
   levels using the RAL3.2 science configuration.

Once the limited area model is all set up, you can go ahead and run the model.

.. note::

   You can also edit the suite by editing the corresponding .conf file in the
   suite directory, if you do not wish to use the Rose graphical user
   interface.
