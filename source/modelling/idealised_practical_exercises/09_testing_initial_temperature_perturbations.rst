*******************************************
Experiment 3 - Size of initial perturbation
*******************************************

The initial temperature field in the suite is perturbed by a small random noise
to induce convective motions, which subsequently grow larger due to convective
instability. To test the sensitivity of the experiment outcome to this
perturbation, we suggest changing the amplitude of this perturbation and
comparing the results to the control experiment.

The parameters that control the initial perturbation are: ``perturb_init`` (to
switch it on), ``perturb_magnitude`` (base-10 logarithm of the perturbation
magnitude), and ``perturb_seed`` - random seed. In the GUI, they are stored in
the **lfric_atm** -> Run Task Settings -> Job -> Initial Conditions.

In the configuration file the namelist is

.. code-block:: ini
   :caption: app/lfric_atm/rose-app.conf
   :emphasize-lines: 3,4,5

   [namelist:idealised]
   f_lon_deg=0.0
   perturb_init=.true.
   perturb_magnitude=1
   perturb_seed=180906
   test='specified_profiles'

.. Note::

   There are other perturbation options in the "Temperature" tab, e.g.
   `perturb` and `pert_width_scaling`, but we are not using them in this
   practical.

Step 1: Change perturbation magnitude
-------------------------------------

.. include:: /include/rose-edit.rst

1. Open Rose GUI or ``app/lfric_atm/rose-app.conf`` in a text editor of your
   choice.
2. Search for the ``perturb_init`` key.
3. Change the value from ``0`` to ``1`` (or ``2``).

Step 2: Run the model
---------------------

Now that you have changed the configuration, run the model using what you have
learnt in the previous exercises. Check the output using Python or another tool
of your choice

Step 3. Compare with the control experiment
-------------------------------------------

Using a Python script or Jupyter Notebook, make plots for both experiments and
compare them to each other to see the effect of the perturbation magnitude.
