What is an idealised configuration?
===================================

Here, we use the term 'idealised' to mean a minimal configuration of
LFRic-Atmosphere that is typically used in research applications.


Idealised convection modelling
------------------------------

We will focus on the so-called the cloud-resolving model (CRM) configuration,
which uses:

* Cartesian-geometry spatial grid
* double periodic lateral boundary conditions
* flat uniform surface
* prescribed domain-wide forcings
* minimal LFRic physics setup

This configuration is used for studying convective processes on Earth and other
planets.

In the practical, we will use a dynamics-only configuration in ``u-dz791``.
This suite is set up for simulating thermo-compositional convection in
hydrogen-rich atmospheres.

Other idealised and extraterrestrial configurations
---------------------------------------------------

There are many other configurations of LFRic-Atmosphere that can be categorised
as 'idealised', to name but a few:

* a global aquaplanet configuration, i.e. Earth without continents (and a slab
  ocean),
* temperature or wind forcing test cases (e.g., the Held-Suarez test) for Earth
  and other planets,
* a setup with radiative transfer and idealised chemistry for hot extrasolar
  gas giants.
