********************************
Experiment 2 - Back to Earth Air
********************************

In this experiment, we go back to the Earth atmospheric composition and test if
convective mixing in this suite behaves in a familiar way.

Step 1: Change the vertical extent of the model
-----------------------------------------------

In the top-level configuration, change the ``LFRIC_LEVS`` to
``uniform_l100_75km``.

    extraterrestrial CRM suite.


Step 2: Change the gas constants
--------------------------------

1. Open Rose GUI or ``app/lfric_atm/rose-app.conf`` in a text editor of your
   choice.
2. Search for the ``cp`` and ``rd`` keys.
3. Set them to

.. code-block:: ini
    :caption: app/lfric_atm/rose-app.conf
    :emphasize-lines: 2,6

    [namelist:planet]
    cp=1005.0
    gravity=9.81
    omega=7.292116E-5
    p_zero=100000.0
    rd=287.05
    scaling_factor=1.0


Step 3: Change the water vapour profile
---------------------------------------

.. Warning::

   This step has to be done in a text editor because we are changing an
   *optional* configuration. Optional configurations are not supported by rose
   edit.

Open the ``rose-app-gungho.conf`` optional configuration (in
``app/lfric_atm/opt/``) in the text editor of your choice.

Change the initial vapour profile values and corresponding heights.

.. code-block:: ini
    :caption: app/lfric_atm/opt/rose-app-gungho.conf
    :emphasize-lines: 2,3

    [namelist:initial_vapour]
    profile_data=0.5,0.5,0.0,0.0
    profile_heights=0,18638,24863,75000
    profile_size=4
    profile_variable='mr'


Step 4: Run the model
---------------------

Now run the model using what you have learnt in the previous exercises. Check
the output using Python or another tool of your choice.

Step 5. Compare with the control experiment
-------------------------------------------

Using a Python script or Jupyter Notebook, make plots for both experiments and
compare them to each other.
