******************************
Navigating the Idealised Suite
******************************

Once you have copied the idealised suite ``u-dz791``, the next step is to
navigate to your copy and open it using the Rose graphical user interface
(GUI).

Step 1: Navigate to the suite directory
---------------------------------------

Open a terminal and change to the directory where your copy of the suite is
located, replacing ``<suite-id>`` with the new suite ID that ``rosie copy``
reported:

.. code-block:: console

   cd ~/roses/<suite-id>

Step 2: Open the suite in the Rose GUI
--------------------------------------

.. include:: /include/rose-edit.rst

Step 3: Setting up the suite's top-level configuration
------------------------------------------------------

Once the GUI is open, you can begin configuring the suite for your specific
experiment or run by navigating through the tabs on the left side of the
window.

Navigate to the ``template variables`` tab to check and, if needed, change the
top-level settings required to run the idealised suite.

Machine, LFRic version, compilation settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **EX_HOST**

  Select what machine to run the experiment on. Currently only the Met Office
  ex1a zone or Monsoon are available.

- **VN**

  LFRic Apps version.

- **BUILD_LFRIC**

  Include compilation of the model (required for the first run).

- **COMPILER**

  Which compiler to use. Note: Cray (``CCE``) is preferred as its faster than
  GNU.


Experiment set up
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **EXPT_DT**

  Dynamical time step of the model in seconds. Default: 10 s.

- **LFRIC_RES**

  Select a horizontal mesh. The convention for bi-periodic Cartesian meshes is
  to name them as ``(number of x-points)x(number of y-points)-(dx)x(dy)``,
  where ``dx`` and ``dy`` are grid steps in the x- and y-directions,
  respectively. Default: 128 by 128 points with the grid spacing of 2000 m.

- **LFRIC_LEVS**

  Select a vertical levels set. Default: 200 uniformly spaced levels from 0 to
  900 km. Yes, *km*. It's a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere, so the scale height
  is much larger than that for Earth's air.

- **PHYSICS_CONF**

  Select a physical configuration. Default: GungHo-only configuration (i.e.,
  dynamical core only).


Cycling options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **EXPT_START**

  Experiment start date and time. Given in a cylc time format: YYYYMMDDTHHMMZ
  The actual numbers are irrelevant for an idealised case.

- **EXPT_RUNLEN**

  Experiment run length in the cylc date-time format, e.g. ``PT10H30M``,
  ``P20D``, etc.

- **EXPT_RESUB**

  Experiment resubmission frequency, i.e. the length of continuation runs, in
  the cylc date-time format.

Parallel execution settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **TOTAL_RANKS_REQ**

  Total number of processors to run the model on. Note: there are 128 per node
  on the ex1a machine and Monsoon.

- **LFRIC_CRUN_WALLCLOCK**

  Wallclock time to allocate to each continuation run. Given in the cylc
  date-time format, e.g. ``PT1H``. Note: the limit is 3 hours on the Met Office
  ex1a zone and Monsoon.

- **HOUSEKEEPING**

  Clean up output directory on successful finish. Currently only removes
  ``xios_*`` log files.

GitHub settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **MIRROR_LOC**

  Alias for the git mirror location. Check your ``~/.gitconfig`` when setting
  this up.

- **USE_MIRRORS**

  If true, use local mirrors to clone the model's source code. If false, clone
  from GitHub.

- **USE_TOKENS**

  If true, switches sources to use https URLs instead of ssh. This requires a
  personal access token to be setup to authenticate with GitHub.
