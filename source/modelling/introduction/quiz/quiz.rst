   ## What is a science configuration in the context of Momentum framework?
   > hint: Think of something that's carefully tested and not changed on a whim.

   > Try again! GC3.1 is earlier than the last UM-based configuration.
   1. [ ] GC4
   > Try again! GC4 is not the last UM-based configuration.
   1. [x] GC5
   > Correct! GC5 was the last configuration to use the UM.
   1. [ ] GC6
   > Try again! GC6 will be the first to use LFRic operationally.

   ## What is LFRic named after?
   > hint: He was a pioneer in weather prediction 1. look for the initials.
   1. [ ] A famous climate model
   > Try again! LFRic is not named after a model.
   1. [ ] Low-Frequency Radiative Instability Code
   > Try again! That's not correct.
   1. [x] Lewis Fry Richardson, a British mathematician
   > Correct! LFRic is named after Lewis Fry Richardson.
   1. [ ] A programming language
   > Try again! It's not a programming language.

   ## How are the GAL and GOSI components coupled?
   > hint: They need a little help from a friend called OASIS.
   1. [ ] Intra-model coupling
   > Try again! Intra-model coupling is for atmosphere-land or ocean-sea ice pairs.
   1. [x] Inter-model coupling via OASIS
   > Correct! They are coupled via OASIS, which is inter-model coupling.
   1. [ ] Manual data transfer
   > Try again! It's not manual.
   1. [ ] Shared memory execution
   > Try again! They don't share memory directly.

   ## Are GC configurations used only for climate projections?
   > hint: Think bigger - weather and climate are both in the mix.
   1. [ ] Yes, only for long-term climate studies
   > Try again! GC configurations are more versatile than that.
   1. [x] No, they are used across weather and climate timescales
   > Correct! GC configurations are used for both weather and climate.
   1. [ ] Only for seasonal forecasts
   > Try again! They are not limited to seasonal forecasts.
   1. [ ] Only for operational NWP
   > Try again! They are used for more than just NWP.

   ## What is the first GC configuration to use LFRic operationally?
   > hint: It's the highest number in the list.
   1. [ ] GC4
   > Try again! GC4 uses the UM, not LFRic.
   1. [ ] GC5
   > Try again! GC5 also uses the UM.
   1. [ ] GC5-LFRic
   > Try again! GC5-LFRic is a research version, not operational.
   1. [x] GC6
   > Correct! GC6 will be the first operational use of LFRic.

   ## What are PEGs and CoGs?
   > hint: Not mechanical parts, but groups of people.
   1. [ ] Types of model components
   > Try again! They are not model components.
   1. [x] Evaluation and collaboration groups within the GC development process
   > Correct! PEGs and CoGs are groups that help evaluate and develop GC configurations.
   1. [ ] Ocean modelling tools
   > Try again! They are not tools.
   1. [ ] Coupling interfaces
   > Try again! They are not interfaces.

   1. [ ] It reduces the need for ocean models
   > Try again! Seamless modelling is about more than just ocean models.
   1. [x] It enables consistent modelling across timescales and spatial resolutions
   > Correct! Seamless modelling ensures consistency across different scales.

   > Try again! Publishing reports is not their main role.

   ## Why are the atmosphere and land models integrated into a single executable?
   > hint: They need to talk to each other every timestep.
   1. [ ] To reduce memory usage
   > Try again! Memory usage is not the main reason.
   1. [x] Because they are physically interconnected and exchange data every timestep
   > Correct! The atmosphere and land models are closely linked and need to exchange data frequently.
   1. [ ] To simplify the codebase
   > Try again! Code simplicity is not the main reason.
   1. [ ] To allow for manual tuning
