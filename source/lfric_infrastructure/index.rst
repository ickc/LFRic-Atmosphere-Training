3. LFRic code and software
**************************

In this section, LFRic is introduced from a software perspective, focusing
on the LFRic Atmosphere model and its underlying components.

.. admonition:: In this module you will learn about...

   * how LFRic Atmosphere fits within the wider LFRic software stack and the Momentum Framework;
   * how the LFRic codebase is split across LFRic Core, LFRic Apps, and larger science component repositories;
   * how the PSyKAl architecture and PSyclone separate scientific code from parallelisation, data movement, and performance concerns;
   * which development tools and repositories you need to work with LFRic source code, configurations, and tests;
   * where the LFRic working practices are documented, including guidance on issues, branches, testing, reviews, and multi-repository development;
   * where to find support when you are unsure how to apply the working practices;
   * how model output is controlled through XIOS and the ``iodef.xml`` configuration file.

.. admonition:: At the end of this module you should be able to...

   * describe the main LFRic code repositories and identify which parts of the model they contain;
   * recognise the role of LFRic Apps, LFRic Core, science component repositories, dependencies, and interfaces in a model build;
   * explain, at a high level, how the algorithm, kernel, and PSy layers fit together in the PSyKAl approach;
   * find the appropriate working-practice guidance before creating issues, branches, tests, reviews, or multi-repository changes;
   * identify the support routes for questions about LFRic development and working practices;
   * follow the practical workflow for checking out code, compiling, running a simple configuration, making a small change, and using tests as evidence;
   * locate and modify ``iodef.xml`` to control which fields are written, at what frequency, and to which output files.

Platform and prerequisites
==========================

The practical pages in this module assume access to a prepared Unix-like
development platform that can build and run LFRic Atmosphere. They are not a
from-a-clean-operating-system installation guide.

Load the supported module stack for your platform, as also shown in
:ref:`practical_3.1`:

.. include:: /include/lfric-modules.rst

Where a course uses Azure Spice, treat it as this prepared Met Office platform
route rather than as a portable installation requirement.

   * - Requirement
     - Used for
     - How to obtain it
   * - Unix-like shell environment
     - Checking out code, running commands, inspecting logs, and launching
       workflows.
     - Use the Met Office managed LFRic environment, Monsoon3, or an
       equivalent site-supported Linux or HPC environment.
   * - Git and GitHub repository access
     - Cloning LFRic Apps, the example workflow, and any training branches.
     - Follow your site's GitHub access guidance. The platform tabs give the
       repository URLs used by each practical. On Monsoon3, clone over HTTPS
       rather than SSH.
   * - Fortran/C/C++ build toolchain, MPI, NetCDF/HDF5, and build utilities
     - Compiling the atmosphere executable and linked science components.
     - Use the ``lfric`` module stack at the Met Office, or the toolchain
       documented for your supported LFRic platform.
   * - Python and PSyclone
     - Running build scripts and generating PSy-layer Fortran from LFRic
       source.
     - Use the supported LFRic build environment for your platform.
   * - Rose, Cylc, and FCM
     - Running workflows, managing configurations, and running stem tests.
     - Use the Met Office module stack or your site's workflow tooling
       installation.
   * - MOSRS and, where required, SVN access
     - Working with shared Met Office repositories and legacy repository
       workflows used by some development practices.
     - Request access through your Met Office or partner support route before
       attempting those exercises.

.. important::

   The development environment in this repository's README is for building
   these training pages with Sphinx. It does not provide the full compiler,
   workflow, and runtime stack needed to build or run LFRic Atmosphere.

Before starting the practical exercises, check that your platform can clone the
required repositories, load the LFRic build environment, and run ``git``,
``python``, ``rose``, ``cylc``, ``fcm``, and the required compiler commands. If
one of those checks fails, use your local platform documentation or support
route before continuing.
